---

## Workflow Strategies

### Strategy 1: Sequential Handoff (Recommended for Complex Projects)

#### Phase 1: Strategic Planning with Claude
```
Prompt: "I want to build [project description]. Please provide:
1. High-level architecture recommendations
2. Technology stack analysis
3. Security considerations
4. Scalability planning
5. Implementation roadmap"
```

**Deliverables**: Architecture docs, tech stack decisions, security requirements

#### Phase 2: SPARC Orchestration with Roo Code
```
# In SPARC Orchestrator mode:
"Using the architecture from Claude [paste architecture], please break this project down using SPARC methodology and delegate tasks to specialized modes."
```

**Deliverables**: Structured project breakdown, specialized task delegation

#### Phase 3: Autonomous Implementation with Copilot Agent
```
# In GitHub Copilot Agent mode:
"Implement the specifications from SPARC following the architecture from Claude. Focus on [specific feature/module]."
```

**Deliverables**: Working code, tests, documentation

### Strategy 2: Parallel Consultation (Best for Medium Projects)

#### Simultaneous Development
1. **Claude**: Provide ongoing architectural guidance
2. **Roo Code SPARC**: Maintain project structure and quality
3. **Copilot Agent**: Handle implementation details

#### Example Workflow:
```
1. Start SPARC Orchestrator with initial requirements
2. Consult Claude for complex decisions as they arise
3. Use Copilot Agent for rapid implementation cycles
4. Return to SPARC for integration and quality assurance
```

### Strategy 3: Iterative Enhancement (Perfect for Existing Projects)

#### Enhancement Cycle:
1. **Claude**: Analyze current codebase and suggest improvements
2. **Roo Code SPARC**: Plan implementation of improvements
3. **Copilot Agent**: Execute the improvements
4. **Repeat**: Continuous improvement loop

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Building a Full-Stack E-commerce Platform

#### Step 1: Claude Strategic Analysis
```
"I want to build a modern e-commerce platform with these requirements:
- User authentication and profiles
- Product catalog with search
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Payment processing
- Admin dashboard
- Mobile responsive

Please provide architectural recommendations, tech stack, and security considerations."
```

**Claude Output**: 
- Recommends microservices architecture
- Suggests React/Next.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend
- Recommends PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- Security: JWT tokens, input validation, HTTPS
- Payment: Stripe integration

#### Step 2: SPARC Methodology Planning
```
# In Roo Code SPARC Orchestrator:
"Using this architecture from Claude [paste], break down the e-commerce platform using SPARC methodology. Create specialized tasks for each component."
```

**SPARC Output**:
- Specification Writer: Detailed user stories and API specs
- Architect: Database schema and API design
- Auto-Coder: Implementation tasks by module
- TDD: Test specifications
- Security Reviewer: Security implementation checklist

#### Step 3: Autonomous Implementation
```
# In GitHub Copilot Agent:
"Implement the user authentication module according to SPARC specifications. Include JWT token management, password hashing, and input validation."
```

**Copilot Output**: Complete auth module with tests

### Example 2: API Enhancement Project

#### Quick Enhancement Workflow:
```
1. Claude: "Analyze this existing API [paste code] and suggest performance improvements"
2. SPARC: "Plan implementation of Claude's suggestions using SPARC methodology"
3. Copilot: "Implement the performance improvements with backward compatibility"
```

### Example 3: Bug Fix Workflow

#### Trifecta Bug Resolution:
```
1. Claude: "This code has a bug [paste error]. What's the root cause and best fix approach?"
2. SPARC Debugger: "Fix the bug following Claude's analysis while maintaining code quality"
3. Copilot: "Implement the fix and add regression tests"
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: The "Wisdom Council"
For critical decisions, consult all three simultaneously:

```
1. Present problem to Claude for strategic analysis
2. Ask SPARC Orchestrator for structured approach
3. Get Copilot Agent's implementation perspective
4. Synthesize the three viewpoints into final decision
```

### Technique 2: Model Rotation with OpenRouter
Leverage different models for different tasks:

```javascript
// Example: Rotate models based on task type
const modelSelection = {
  architecture: "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
  implementation: "openai/gpt-4-turbo",
  documentation: "google/gemini-pro",
  testing: "meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b"
};
```

### Technique 3: The "Code Review Triangle"
```
1. Copilot Agent: Implements feature
2. SPARC Security Reviewer: Audits for security and quality
3. Claude: Provides strategic code review and optimization suggestions
```

### Technique 4: Continuous Integration Loop
```
1. Copilot Agent: Commits code to branch
2. SPARC Integration: Reviews and merges changes
3. Claude: Monitors overall project health and suggests architectural improvements
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Tools Giving Conflicting Advice
**Solution**: Use Claude as the "tie-breaker" for architectural decisions, SPARC for process decisions, and Copilot for implementation details.

#### Issue: Context Loss Between Tools
**Solution**: Maintain a shared PROJECT_MANIFEST.md that gets updated after each major decision or implementation.

#### Issue: Over-Engineering
**Solution**: Set clear scope boundaries and use SPARC's modular approach to prevent feature creep.

#### Issue: Integration Complexity
**Solution**: Start simple with Strategy 1 (Sequential Handoff) before attempting parallel workflows.

### Debug Commands

#### Check SPARC Status:
```bash
# In Roo Code, check current project status
cat .roo/PROJECT_STATUS.md
```

#### Verify Copilot Agent Status:
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions for agent activity
gh run list --repo your-repo
```

#### Claude Context Management:
```
"Summarize our current project status and next steps based on our conversation history."
```

## Best Practices

### The Golden Rules

#### 1. **Single Source of Truth**
- Maintain one primary source for architectural decisions (usually Claude's output)
- Update PROJECT_MANIFEST.md after every major decision
- Use version control for all tool outputs

#### 2. **Clear Role Boundaries**
- **Claude**: Strategy and architecture
- **SPARC**: Process and methodology
- **Copilot**: Implementation and deployment

#### 3. **Iterative Validation**
```
Every major milestone:
1. Claude validates strategic alignment
2. SPARC validates process adherence
3. Copilot validates implementation quality
```

#### 4. **Context Preservation**
- Save important outputs from each tool
- Reference previous decisions in new prompts
- Maintain conversation continuity

#### 5. **Quality Gates**
```
Before proceeding to next phase:
âœ… Claude approves architecture
âœ… SPARC completes current phase
âœ… Copilot passes all tests
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Tool Selection Matrix:
| Task Type | Primary Tool | Secondary | Tertiary |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Architecture Design | Claude | SPARC Architect | - |
| Implementation | Copilot Agent | SPARC Auto-Coder | - |
| Testing | SPARC TDD | Copilot Agent | Claude |
| Documentation | SPARC Docs Writer | Claude | Copilot |
| Debugging | SPARC Debugger | Copilot Agent | Claude |
| Security Review | SPARC Security | Claude | Copilot |
| Deployment | Copilot Agent | SPARC DevOps | Claude |

### Cost Management

#### Model Selection Strategy:
```
High-complexity tasks: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (premium)
Medium tasks: GPT-4 Turbo (balanced)
Simple tasks: OpenRouter free models
Bulk operations: Fastest available model
```

#### Request Optimization:
- Batch similar requests to same tool
- Use model switching in OpenRouter for cost efficiency
- Cache common architectural decisions
